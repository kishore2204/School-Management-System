A comprehensive School Management System project, meticulously crafted with Python for frontend interactivity and MySQL for robust backend data management. Designed to cater to the needs of educational institutions, it introduces three distinct user roles—teachers, admin, and office staff—to streamline administrative workflows and elevate the educational experience.
